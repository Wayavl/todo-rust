A simple project focused on doing a modern ToDo app with the following requirements: 
- Redis (session)
- PostgresSQL (data)
- React (frontend)
- Rust (backend)

I want to make everything work in a container, but now I am in early developtment stages ( I started the project 01/07/2025 ). My plan is to have MVP on 14/07/2025, tt might be a lot of time, however I have to learn and React, Rust, PostgresSQL and redis during 
the process so I think it will be enough.

I would be updating the readme once the project progress.
